Ready-made unit test libraries are commonly used in writing tests, which provide methods and help classes for writing tests. 
The most common unit testing library in Java is JUnit , which is also supported by almost all programming environments. 
For example, NetBeans can automatically search for JUnit tests in a project â€” if any are found, they will be displayed under the project 
in the Test Packages folder.

Required Packages to be imported:
	-static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
	-org.junit.Test
Annotation:
	-@Test
Functions:
	-assertEquals(expectedValue, calculatedValue)
