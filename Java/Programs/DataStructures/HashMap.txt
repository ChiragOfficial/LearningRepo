-   Using a hash map requires the import java.util.HashMap; statement at the beginning of the class.
-   put(*key*, *value*) - to add a new hash map.
-   get(*key*) - retrieving the value of the given key.
-   If a new key-value pair is added to the hash map, but the key has already been associated with some other value stored 
    in the hash map, the old value will vanish from the hash map.
-   DRY Principle - Don't Repeat Yourself Principle. Write down the codes in the class itself that automate repeated tasks.
-   keySet() method - Returns a Set of keys in the HashMap
